# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

how to run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. cd data-search or go to where src folder is
3. npm install/ npm i
4. npm run dev

time took for me complete this task: 4.30 hours

best practices I've implemented in my code:
1. Component Reusability
2. Defining constants and strong file structure
3. Keeping it simple and easy to use by using hooks, naming convention
